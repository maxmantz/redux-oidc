[![CI](https://github.com/ericlamb/redux-oidc/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ericlamb/redux-oidc/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Forked from [maxmantz/redux-oidc](https://github.com/maxmantz/redux-oidc).

A package for managing OpenID-Connect authentication in ReactJS / Redux apps. It wraps the popular oidc-client library to redux actions and reducers.

### Description

This package handles [OpenID-Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) authentication in [redux](http://redux.js.org/) apps. It enables redux apps to authenticate with an external OIDC authentication provider and handles the actions of the OpenID [implicit flow](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-implicit-1_0.html) or [authorization code flow](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/04/10/oauth-authorization-code-grant-type).

It uses the oidc-client-js library to manage OpenID Connect functionality.

It contains the following parts:
- *CallbackComponent*: A react component processing the signin callback from the OpenID-Connect provider,
- *SignoutCallbackComponent*: A react component processing the signout callback from the OpenID-Connect provider,
- *reducers & actions*: reducers and actions to handle OIDC events,
- *helpers*: create helpers to manage the oidc-client-js library

### Installation
`npm install --save redux-oidc`

#### Peer dependencies
This package wraps [oidc-client-js](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js) to use with ReactJS / Redux apps.
Install oidc-client like this:

`npm install --save oidc-client`

In addition there is a peer dependency for [immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), if you want to use it.

#### babel-polyfill
You need the [babel-polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) in your build configuration for this package to work.


### Version 4 released
*BREAKING CHANGE*: `immutable` is no longer a dependency. If you are using the immutable reducer, please check out the [docs](https://github.com/maxmantz/redux-oidc/blob/master/docs/API.md#immutable-reducer).

#### Documentation
You can find the docs for version 3 here:
- [API docs](docs/API.md),
- [actions](docs/Actions.md),
- [example app](https://github.com/maxmantz/redux-oidc-example)

#### Note for react-native users
This library doesn't fully support react-native apps. Please use [this](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-native-app-auth) library instead.

### Version 2

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/maxmantz/redux-oidc/wiki) for further information for Version 2 (deprecated).

### Sample app
There is a sample application demonstrating the use of this package [here](https://github.com/maxmantz/redux-oidc-example).

### Tests
You have to install immutableJS for all the tests to pass: `npm install immutable --no-save`.
Then run `npm run test`.
